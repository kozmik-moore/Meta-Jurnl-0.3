So, while I did not behave anywhere near as I wanted in the course of the conversation between Aria and I concerning the dogs, I did make an attempt to censure myself. That is an improvement over my usual behavior. Also, walking out to cool off may have been an improvement: I feel, though, that I did that just to get away from Aria and the confining space that is our house. I feel secure in saying that because I am cooler now, but still avoiding being in the house with that air of the previous argument hanging around.
