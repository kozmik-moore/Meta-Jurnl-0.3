	I wish that I had a way to take a more descriptive snapshot of the work I have done here.

	This has come along so far and it is amazing what I have gotten to work. This thing can link thoughts together, display trees of thought progression, sort by user tags, manage tags for selection, add and manage attachments, and, of course, store thoughts in written format. Add in some text formatting and emotion registers and I will be ahead of where I was two(?) years ago when I had somebody else managing my thoughts for me. And, to christen the new module, I've added a photo of me, happy as an overworked clam.
